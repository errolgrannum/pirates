# Pirates: A Clojure implementation of the Cartagena board game.

This was my first non-trivial Clojure project. It's an implementation of the [Cartagena board 
game](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/826/cartagena) in Clojure. The rules are all found in rules.cljx. Cljx was used
since at some point I'd like to make a web gui as well. The program can be launched from swingui.clj. I apologize up
front for the programmer art. The main goal was to explore how a desktop app could be written in Clojure. Coming from 
the Java and Scala worlds, I was quite impressed by how concise the application is. The majority of the code is Swing,
and that could probably be reduced a lot using seesaw or similar.

## Installation

From a repl, uncomment and run the frame method. Alternatively, lein run does the trick. You can also bundle the app
with lein compile, lein uberjar.

## Usage

Double-click the executable jar. To take a turn, right click on the square with your colored dot (pirate) and select an
action. Once you have all of your pirates in the boat, you win. You are assigned a color (pick the one you want that
pops up) and when your cards (icons on the right) are your color, it is your turn. It's a pretty minimal UI :(

One thing I've noticed is that the initial UI may not display correctly on Windows. If you resize the frame it will render correctly. I've only got a Mac, so can't easily debug.

## Design

This app was written as more of an exercise in learning Clojure than in writing a fun game (that takes a lot of work),
but the cool pattern I've used since is 1) creating business logic in pure functional form, 2) creating a stateful UI in
whatever framework you want, and 3) using an atom, agent, or ref to manage a state instance that bridges the UI and the 
logic. Pretty cool!

If anyone out there wants to add AI, better art, online multiplayer, etc. I'd be more than happy to accept input or collaborate.
